# HeadBonk
My very first bigger game

dont ask me why i named it "Head Bonk" while the menu says "Run faster", i dont know either...

i cant remember why but i only made 3 levels even though it has the option to play way more
the game might include some little bugs, i made this as one of my first java applications, did learn a lot about java this way though
i will not be adding any new levels, i am just uploading it so i wont somehow accidentally delete one of my first bigger programs

it also seems like i intended on adding a combat system since the sprites are there and i started on the combat system

the hitboxes on the menu screen are on because i was debugging

when playing from the jar file, data wont be saved. data will only be saved when running the game from the terminal or an IDE.

i sadly dont remember where i got the sprites from because 70% of it was downloaded from some website
so credits to whoever drew the sprites
